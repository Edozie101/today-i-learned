This directory is for TILs inspired by the [Udacity course on Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/progress#!/c-ud015). TILs posted here are designed to keep a record of what people have taken away from the course as it progresses. This record can be reviewed by those taking the course as revision or by those who haven't taken the course who would like to learn more about Object-Oriented JavaScript.
