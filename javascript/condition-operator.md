**The condition operator**

The ternary operator-also called the condition operator- allows us to return different values depending on the results of checks.
It is an alternative to if...else statement, which can be shorter and clearer, in some cases.

Example:
```javascript

return result===0 ? 0 : "Result should have been 0" ;


```

In this case, we check for the variable result. If it is strictly equal to zero, return zero. Else, return "Result should have been 0"  

It's an awesome tool that'll add readability to your code. Special thanks to warrior @GiacomoSorbi which posted a kata about it on the gitter channel ;)
