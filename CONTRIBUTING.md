# Contributing

1. When you learn something, add a Markdown file to this repo explaining it in concise terms
1. Place the file in a directory which best describes the content of the tip
1. Create a new directory if no existing one fits
1. Open a pull request for your TIL

**Example:**  
If your TIL is related to testing, look for a directory related to tests (e.g. "testing").  
If there is not already a related directory, create your own and add your TIL there.

## Writing a good a TIL

TIL's should be a focused and concise piece of knowledge that's interesting and
worth sharing with others.

Guidelines on how to write a great TIL:

- Avoid writing more than 60 lines of content
- Avoid writing more than 2 examples
- Avoid going into too much detail

If you find your TIL straying from these guidelines, consider

- narrowing the scope of your TIL
- splitting it up into multiple TILs
- writing a blog post on the subject

When adding your TIL, see [here for a concise guide on naming conventions for
files/directories on GitHub](https://github.com/sofer/stuff/blob/master/naming.md).
