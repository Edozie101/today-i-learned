# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining
concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

For new TILs, watch this repo.

[Please follow our contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) when posting a new TIL.
