There are several sections on GitHub that are good for just playing around
and getting comfortable with GitHub. This will be added to as I find new things,
or add your own links!

- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) - this contains guides with various
topics ranging from [GitHub essentials](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
to mastering markdown, issues, and wikis.
- [Explore GitHub](https://github.com/explore) - this can also be accessed by clicking
on your profile photo and choosing 'Explore' from the drop down list. Great for
just seeing what other people are working on, and how they are using GitHub.
