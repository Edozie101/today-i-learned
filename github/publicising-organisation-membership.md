When you join an organisation, the default setting is private. This means when people view your profile, they will not see which organisations you belong to. However, sometimes you want to tell the world "I'm part of Coding for Everyone!"

You can publicise which organisations you belong to on GitHub. The steps can [be found here](https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/), and a condensed version is below.

- Go to the organisation
- Click on "People" found on the right-hand side
- Search for your GitHub user name
- Click on "Private", and switch it to "Public"
