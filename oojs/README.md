This directory is for TILs from the realm of object-oriented JavaScript
programming. It was inspired by those currently taking
[Udacity course on Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/progress#!/c-ud015).
We wanted to keep a record of the key OOJS learning points in the form of TILs.
It is open to contributions from anyone! See the
